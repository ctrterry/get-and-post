MicroBlog is a simple blogging platform designed for educational purposes. It allows users to register, log in, create posts, like other users' posts, and delete their own posts. In Part A of this project, you'll establish the foundation for your MicroBlog application using Express for server-side logic and Handlebars for templating. By implementing core features like post creation, liking posts, and basic user authentication, you'll gain practical experience with Express routing, session management, and dynamic content generation. This initial structure is designed to set you up for success in Part B, where you'll migrate posts and users to an SQL database and implement OAuth authentication. The foundational work in Part A provides a cohesive workflow from user authentication to post interactions and a flexible architecture with Handlebars templates, helping you efficiently organize your views. In the final part of the project, you'll have the opportunity to customize the design and features to align with your vision, building upon the solid core established in Parts A and B while focusing on creative design and advanced features.
